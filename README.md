## Overview
As part of and ongoing training at Amalitech we were to build a multipage website for a designer company.

### The challenge
The challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to
the design as possible.

- A user would like the website to adapt to the screen size of different
devices. 
- A user, should be able to see visual feedback (hover states) when I
hover on elements on the page so that I can see which item is currently in
focus. 
- A user should receive an error message when the contact form is
submitted if:
○ The Name, Email Address or Message fields are empty should show &quot;This
field can&#39;t be empty&quot;
○ The Email Address is not formatted correctly should show &quot;Please use a valid
email address&quot;

## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Family: [Jost]("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:wght@400;500;600&display=swap")
- Mobile first approach
- JavaScript

### What I learned
- Positioning with FlexBox
- Postitioning with Grid
- Making Pull Request
- Responsive Web Designing

### Continued development
This site will continously be updated as we learn new things and better way of doing things.

### Useful resources
[CodeAcademy front-end engineering](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) - This  is a great site where we learnt 
most of the format we used in building this site.
